## [EDA_1](https://github.com/edoruin/EDA_practices/blob/main/EDA_1.ipynb)
This is a simple practice on the data exploration process, focused on the productivity and effectiveness of visualizations over complexity. The goal is to enhance the quality of my insights and the objectives that I found to analyze in the data.

### Approach
The project aims to analyze the data from an online store, randomly generated by ChatGPT. The task is to analyze the data and provide recommendations on how to improve the company's profits. The available data for this task includes profits, costs, sales, new customers, lost customers, and total customers.

## Installation

No installation is required; the code is hosted on Google Colab. However, if you want to download the file, there are code lines specifying the necessary libraries to prevent any inconvenience.

## Usage

It is recommended to download as a notebook. Simply run the cells in the order they appear, and they will display the results of the code lines.
